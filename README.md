# Claude Recall

An MCP server that gives Claude persistent memory across conversations.

Every time you start a new conversation with Claude, you're starting from scratch. Claude doesn't remember your preferences, your project context, or the decisions you've made together. Until now.

**Claude Recall** is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that gives Claude persistent memory across conversations. It learns from your interactions and provides relevant context in future conversations, making Claude feel like a true collaborator who remembers your journey together.

## Key Features

### 🧠 Intelligent Learning Loop
- **Never repeat yourself** - State preferences once, Claude remembers forever
- **Learn from outcomes** - Automatically captures what worked and what didn't
- **Direct MCP search** - Fast, simple memory lookup (milliseconds, no agent overhead)
- **Automatic application** - Preferences and successful patterns applied without asking
- **Persistent across restarts** - Your learnings survive Claude Code restarts

### 📝 Intelligent Capture
- **Automatic extraction** - Captures preferences, patterns, and important information from conversations
- **Categorized storage** - Organizes memories by type (preferences, project knowledge, corrections)
- **Priority-based** - More important or frequently used memories are prioritized

### ⚡ Advanced Features
- **Direct MCP calls** - Fast memory search without agent overhead (milliseconds)
- **Comprehensive search** - Single search finds preferences, successes, failures, and corrections
- **Outcome capture** - Stores what worked and what didn't for future learning
- **Learning loop** - Pre-action search → Execute → Post-action outcome → Future tasks apply learnings
- **Optional agent** - Advanced context-manager agent available for complex workflows
- **Correction priority** - User corrections given highest priority (never repeat mistakes)

### 🧠 Intelligence & Evolution
- **Sophistication tracking** - Measures agent progression from basic tool use to compositional reasoning
- **Failure learning** - Captures what failed, why it failed, and what should be done instead (counterfactual reasoning)
- **Evolution metrics** - View progression score, confidence trends, and failure rates over time
- **Structured memories** - Rich Title/Description/Content format for better human readability
- **Automatic classification** - Memories auto-classified by sophistication level (L1-L4)

### 🔒 Privacy & Security First
- **100% Local** - All memories stored locally in SQLite (~/.claude-recall/)
- **No cloud sync** - Your data never leaves your machine
- **You own your data** - Export, view, or delete memories at any time
- **Zero telemetry** - No data collection or phone-home behavior
- **Security audited** - Reviewed using `/security-review` command: No exposed secrets, SQL injection protection, 0 npm vulnerabilities

## Quick Start

### Recommended: Local Project Installation

**Install in each project where you want Claude Recall:**

```bash
cd your-project
npm install claude-recall
```

**What this does:**
- ✅ Creates `.claude/` directory with memory-first workflow instructions
- ✅ Configures MCP server in `~/.claude.json` (global, works everywhere)
- ✅ Adds to `package.json` (team members get it automatically)
- ✅ CLI available via `npx claude-recall stats`

**After installation, verify:**
```bash
npx claude-recall --version   # Should show installed version
```

### Enable Autonomous Memory Agent

**Start the memory agent for real-time memory capture:**

```bash
npx claude-recall agent start
```

**What this does:**
- 🤖 Starts background process that monitors tool/prompt events via PubNub
- ⚡ Non-blocking hooks (<10ms) publish events without slowing Claude Code
- 🧠 Agent autonomously searches/stores memories based on your activity
- 📊 View status: `npx claude-recall agent status`
- 📋 View logs: `npx claude-recall agent logs`

**How it works:**
1. **Hooks installed automatically** - PubNub hooks publish events (fire-and-forget)
2. **Agent receives events** - Subscribes to tool execution and prompt events
3. **Memory operations** - Searches relevant memories proactively, stores preferences automatically
4. **No Claude Code blocking** - All heavy lifting happens in background process

**Agent commands:**
```bash
npx claude-recall agent start      # Start the agent
npx claude-recall agent stop       # Stop the agent
npx claude-recall agent restart    # Restart the agent
npx claude-recall agent status     # Check if running
npx claude-recall agent logs       # View agent activity
```

### Why Local Over Global?

**Local installation (`npm install claude-recall`):**
- ✅ `.claude/CLAUDE.md` auto-created in your project
- ✅ `.claude/agents/` available for Claude Code
- ✅ Team members get it via `package.json`
- ✅ Use `npx claude-recall` for CLI
- ✅ MCP server still works globally

**Global installation (`npm install -g`):**
- ❌ `.claude/` directory NOT auto-created
- ❌ Must manually copy integration files to each project
- ❌ Harder to share with team
- ✅ CLI available without `npx`

**Bottom line:** Install locally in each project. The MCP server (`~/.claude.json`) and database (`~/.claude-recall/`) are shared globally anyway, so you get the best of both worlds.

### If You Have Global Installation

**Remove it:**
```bash
npm uninstall -g claude-recall
```

**Then install locally in each project** as shown above. Your memories in `~/.claude-recall/claude-recall.db` are preserved!

### Cross-Platform Compatibility

Claude Recall works on **Windows, Linux, and macOS**. Native binaries (SQLite) compile automatically for your platform during `npm install`.

**WSL Users - Special Case:**

If you use **both Windows and WSL** for the same project (e.g., Electron app runs on Windows, but you use WSL):

**Problem**: Installing locally creates Windows binaries, but WSL needs Linux binaries → "invalid ELF header" errors.

**Solution**: Use WSL-specific local installation:
```bash
# From WSL, in your project directory:
cd /path/to/your-project
npm install claude-recall

# This installs Linux binaries AND hook scripts
# MCP server configured in ~/.claude.json works for all projects
```

**Why this works**:
- WSL gets Linux binaries (no ELF errors)
- Hooks installed to project's `.claude/hooks/` (automatic memory search enforcement works)
- MCP server in `~/.claude.json` is global (works everywhere)
- Memory database `~/.claude-recall/` is global (shared across projects)

**Alternative (NOT recommended)**: If you absolutely need global installation:
```bash
npm install -g claude-recall

# ⚠️ WARNING: You MUST manually install hooks to each project:
cd your-project
mkdir -p .claude/hooks
cp $(npm root -g)/claude-recall/.claude/hooks/* .claude/hooks/
cp $(npm root -g)/claude-recall/.claude/settings.json .claude/settings.json
```

This manual approach loses automatic setup and team sharing via `package.json`.

### Node.js Version Requirement

Claude Recall requires **Node.js 20+** due to native dependencies (better-sqlite3). If you're on Node 18 or older:

**Install Node 20 using nvm:**
```bash
# Install nvm (if not already installed)
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.3/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc

# Install Node 20
nvm install 20
nvm use 20
node --version  # Should show v20.x.x
```

**Reinstall claude-recall with Node 20:**
```bash
cd ~/path-to-project-dir
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install claude-recall
npx claude-recall --version
```

## Updating Claude Recall

**For local installations (recommended):**

```bash
# 1. Update in your project
cd your-project
npm install claude-recall@latest

# 2. Restart Claude Code
```

**For global installations (not recommended):**

```bash
# 1. Update globally
npm install -g claude-recall@latest

# 2. Restart Claude Code
```

**Note:** MCP server configuration in `~/.claude.json` persists across updates. You only need to update the package.

### Database Migration

Claude Recall automatically migrates your database schema when updating. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for version-specific migration notes if upgrading from older versions.

### 🚀 Revolutionary Architecture: Fire-and-Forget Memory

**What Makes This Different:**

Traditional memory systems block your workflow while processing. Claude Recall uses a **revolutionary event-driven architecture** that keeps Claude Code fast while memory operations happen autonomously in the background.

**The Innovation:**

```
┌─────────────┐                  ┌─────────────┐                ┌──────────────────┐
│ Claude Code │                  │   PubNub    │                │  Memory Agent    │
│             │                  │ Message Bus │                │   (Daemon)       │
└──────┬──────┘                  └──────┬──────┘                └────────┬─────────┘

       │  Tool use (Write/Edit/Bash)    │                                │
       ├────────────────────────────────>                                │
       │                                │                                │

       │  Continue execution            │   Event received               │
       │  (no blocking!)                ├────────────────────────────────>
       │                                │                                │
       │                                │   Agent processes:             │
       │                                │   - Search memories            │
       │                                │   - Store preferences          │
       │                                │   - Learn from patterns        │
       │                                │   (all async)                  │
       │                                │                                │
```

**Key Architectural Advantages:**

1. **<10ms Latency** - Hooks publish events and return immediately, no blocking
2. **True Autonomy** - Memory agent runs as independent daemon process
3. **Event-Driven Decoupling** - PubNub acts as message bus between Claude Code and agent
4. **Zero Performance Impact** - All memory operations happen in background thread
5. **Real-Time Pub/Sub** - Agent subscribes to events, processes asynchronously
6. **Fault Isolation** - If agent crashes, Claude Code continues working

**Automatic Setup:**

When you `npm install claude-recall`, the installer automatically:
1. Creates `.claude/hooks/` directory in your project
2. Installs PubNub hook scripts:
   - `pubnub_pre_tool_hook.py` - Publishes tool execution events (fire-and-forget)
   - `pubnub_prompt_hook.py` - Publishes user prompts for preference extraction
3. Configures `.claude/settings.json` with hook bindings

**How It Works:**

```python
# Hook executes in <10ms:
1. Receive tool execution event from Claude Code
2. Publish to PubNub (fire-and-forget)
3. Return immediately ✓

# Meanwhile, memory agent (running as daemon):
4. Receives event from PubNub
5. Searches relevant memories
6. Stores new patterns
7. Updates memory database
   (all happens asynchronously, doesn't block Claude Code)
```

**Configuration:**

Hooks are configured in `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit|Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "python3 .claude/hooks/pubnub_pre_tool_hook.py"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "python3 .claude/hooks/pubnub_prompt_hook.py"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Requirements:**
- Python 3 (pre-installed on most systems)
- Memory agent running: `npx claude-recall agent start`
- Hook scripts installed automatically during `npm install`

**Troubleshooting:**

If hooks aren't working:
1. Check Python is available: `python3 --version`
2. Verify hooks are installed: `ls .claude/hooks/`
3. Check agent status: `npx claude-recall agent status`
4. View agent logs: `npx claude-recall agent logs`
5. Restart agent: `npx claude-recall agent restart`

## Verifying Claude Recall is Working

To confirm claude-recall is active in your Claude Code session:

**1. Check MCP Server Status**
```bash
claude mcp list
```
Should show `claude-recall` in the list of active servers.

**2. Ask Claude to Search Memories**
Simply ask: "Search my memories for [anything]" - Claude should be able to call the search tool.

**3. Check Available MCP Tools**
Ask Claude: "What MCP tools do you have access to?" - Claude should list tools starting with `mcp__claude-recall__` including:
- `mcp__claude-recall__store_memory`
- `mcp__claude-recall__retrieve_memory`
- `mcp__claude-recall__search`

**4. Store and Retrieve a Test Memory**
```
You: "Remember that I prefer testing with Jest"
Claude: [Should call store_memory tool]

You: "What testing framework do I prefer?"
Claude: [Should search memories and find Jest]
```

**5. Check Stats via CLI**
```bash
claude-recall stats
```
This shows if memories are being stored.

**6. Check Running Process**
```bash
ps aux | grep claude-recall
```
Should show the MCP server process running.

## PubNub: Fire-and-Forget Architecture

Claude Recall uses **PubNub** as a real-time message bus to enable truly autonomous memory operations with zero performance impact on Claude Code.

###  What is PubNub?

PubNub is a real-time pub/sub messaging service that acts as a message bus between Claude Code and the Memory Agent. When Claude Code executes a tool (Write, Edit, Bash), a lightweight hook publishes an event to PubNub and returns immediately (<10ms). The Memory Agent, running as an independent daemon, subscribes to these events and processes them asynchronously.

**Simple flow:**
```
Claude Code → Hook (<10ms) → PubNub → Memory Agent (background)
       ↓
  Continues immediately
  (zero blocking!)
```

### Why This Matters

- **<10ms hook latency** - Hooks return instantly, no waiting
- **Zero performance impact** - Memory operations happen in background
- **True autonomy** - Agent runs independently, crashes don't affect Claude Code
- **Fault isolation** - If agent fails, Claude Code continues working
- **Real-time pub/sub** - Events flow asynchronously through message bus

### Demo Keys Included

Claude Recall includes **demo PubNub keys** that work out of the box - no signup or configuration required. Perfect for getting started immediately.

**For production use**, you can optionally use your own PubNub keys (free tier available). See [PubNub Integration Guide](docs/PUBNUB_INTEGRATION.md) for details.

## How It Works

Claude Recall implements an **intelligent learning loop** that ensures you never repeat yourself:

### The Learning Loop

1. **Store Preferences**: When you express preferences, they're stored in SQLite
2. **Pre-Action Search**: Before tasks, Claude searches memories directly (fast MCP call)
3. **Find Context**: Search finds preferences + successes + failures + corrections automatically
4. **Execute with Context**: Claude applies what was learned
5. **Capture Outcome**: After task, Claude stores success/failure/correction
6. **Future Application**: Next similar task automatically applies learnings

### Complete Example: Never Repeat Yourself

```
=== First Time: State Preference ===
You: "I prefer Python for scripts"
[Claude stores preference via MCP]

=== Second Time: First Use ===
You: "Create a test script"
[Claude searches: mcp__claude-recall__search("scripts python test")]
[Search finds: "I prefer Python for scripts"]
[Claude creates test.py using Python]
You: "Perfect!"
[Claude stores: "Created test script with Python - SUCCESS"]

=== Third Time: Automatic Application ===
You: "Create a build script"
[Claude searches: mcp__claude-recall__search("scripts build python")]
[Search finds: "I prefer Python" + "test.py SUCCESS"]
[Claude creates build.py automatically - learned pattern!]
You: *Don't have to repeat preference - it was learned!*

=== Correction Loop ===
You: "No, put scripts in scripts/ directory not root"
[Claude stores: "CORRECTION: Scripts in scripts/ directory" (highest priority)]
[Claude moves file immediately]
Next time: Search finds correction and applies automatically
```

## Claude Code Skills Integration

Claude Recall now integrates with **Claude Code Skills** for better LLM compliance and automatic memory management.

### What Are Skills?

Skills are structured task modules that teach Claude how to perform specific workflows. Unlike `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (which are passive instructions), Skills are recognized by Claude Code's runtime and loaded intelligently.

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Better compliance**: Skills are runtime-integrated, not just text instructions
- ✅ **Progressive disclosure**: Only load detailed instructions when needed
- ✅ **Structured format**: YAML frontmatter makes parsing more reliable
- ✅ **Tool teaching**: Explicitly teaches WHEN and HOW to use MCP tools

### Memory Management Skill

**Location:** `.claude/skills/memory-management/SKILL.md`

This Skill teaches Claude to:
1. **Search memories before tasks** - Automatic search before file operations
2. **Store memories after outcomes** - Success/failure/correction capture
3. **Apply learned patterns** - Use devops workflows, preferences automatically
4. **Check what's captured** - Verify automatic capture worked

**Created automatically** when you install Claude Recall in a project.

### Skill Structure

```
.claude/
├── CLAUDE.md                     # Backward compatibility
├── agents/                       # Optional context-manager agent
└── skills/
    └── memory-management/
        ├── SKILL.md              # Main skill definition
        └── references/
            ├── devops-patterns.md      # DevOps capture examples
            ├── capture-examples.md     # Manual storage templates
            └── troubleshooting.md      # Common issues & fixes
```

### How Skills Work

1. **Metadata loaded first** - Claude reads skill name/description (fast)
2. **Full instructions when needed** - Detailed workflow loaded on-demand
3. **References as needed** - Examples and patterns loaded if required

**Example:**
```
User: "Create authentication module"

Claude:
1. Loads memory-management Skill metadata
2. Reads SKILL.md instructions → "Search before tasks"
3. Searches: mcp__claude-recall__search("authentication devops testing")
4. Finds: "Always use JWT" + "Tests in __tests__/" + "TDD approach"
5. Creates auth module following learned patterns
6. Loads references/capture-examples.md for success storage template
7. Stores: "Created auth with JWT - SUCCESS"
```

### Backward Compatibility

**Both work together:**
- **CLAUDE.md** - General instructions for Claude Code
- **SKILL.md** - Specific memory management workflow

Skills take precedence when both exist, but CLAUDE.md provides fallback for users without Skills support.

## How Memory Capture Works

**You don't need to say "remember"** - Claude Recall automatically captures preferences when you speak naturally.

### Automatic Trigger Words

Claude Recall uses a **three-tier priority system** to capture memories:

#### Priority 1: Explicit "Remember" Commands (100% Confidence)
```
"Remember that I prefer TypeScript with strict mode"
```

#### Priority 2 & 3: Automatic Pattern Detection (60%+ Confidence)

**Strong indicators** (boost confidence):
- `prefer`, `always`, `never`
- `from now on`, `moving forward`, `going forward`

**General indicators**:
- `use`, `should`, `want`, `like`, `love`
- `save`, `store`, `put`, `place`, `create`, `make`

### Examples That Work WITHOUT "Remember"

| What You Say | Automatically Captured? | Confidence |
|--------------|------------------------|------------|
| "I prefer TypeScript with strict mode" | ✅ YES | High (80%+) |
| "Always use Jest for testing" | ✅ YES | High (80%+) |
| "Never put tests in the root directory" | ✅ YES | High (80%+) |
| "From now on, use 4 spaces for indentation" | ✅ YES | High (85%+) |
| "I want scripts in the scripts/ folder" | ✅ YES | Medium (70%+) |
| "Use Axios for HTTP requests" | ✅ YES | Medium (70%+) |
| "Tests should go in __tests__/" | ✅ YES | Medium (70%+) |
| "Create files with .ts extension" | ✅ YES | Medium (65%+) |
| "Maybe use React" | ❌ NO | Low (< 60%) |

### Confidence Threshold

- **Minimum confidence**: 60% required for automatic capture
- **"Remember" keyword**: Ensures 100% confidence capture (but not required)
- **Stronger language**: "prefer", "always", "never" boost confidence
- **Override signals**: "from now on", "actually", "instead" boost confidence

**Bottom line**: Speak naturally about your preferences - Claude Recall captures them automatically. Use "remember" only when you want to ensure something is captured with absolute certainty.

## Memory Types

Claude Recall stores different types of memories (sorted by priority):

### 1. DevOps (Highest Priority - v0.5.0+)
- **Project-specific workflows** that are critical to how you work
- Git conventions, testing approaches, build processes
- Development environment setup (WSL, Docker, etc.)
- Architecture decisions, tech stack choices
- **Automatically captured** when you describe your workflow
- **Example**: "We use TDD for all new features"
- **Example**: "Always create feature branches from main"
- **Example**: "This is a teleprompter tool for interviews"

### 2. Corrections
- User explicitly said "No, do this instead"
- Fixes to mistakes Claude made
- Override previous approaches
- **Example**: "CORRECTION: Tests in __tests__/ not tests/"

### 3. Preferences
- Coding style preferences (languages, frameworks, patterns)
- Tool preferences (testing frameworks, build tools)
- File organization, naming conventions
- **Example**: "I prefer TypeScript with strict mode"

### 4. Successes
- What worked in past tasks
- Approaches that user approved
- Validated patterns
- **Example**: "Created auth module with JWT tokens - SUCCESS"

### 5. Failures
- What didn't work and should be avoided
- Approaches that failed or were rejected
- Deprecated approaches
- **Example**: "Session-based auth failed, use JWT instead"

### 6. Project Knowledge
- Database configurations
- API patterns and endpoints
- Infrastructure details (tenant IDs, endpoints)
- Dependencies and versions
- **Example**: "Tenant ID is abc-123"
- **Example**: "API endpoint: https://api.example.com"

### 7. Tool Use
- Historical tool execution
- Command patterns
- Workflow steps

## CLI Commands

All commands can be run from your terminal or **within Claude Code sessions** (Claude can execute them using the Bash tool).

### Memory Operations

**Search memories:**
```bash
npx claude-recall search "database"
npx claude-recall search "auth" --limit 20           # Show up to 20 results
npx claude-recall search "config" --project my-app   # Filter by project + universal
npx claude-recall search "testing" --global          # Search all projects
npx claude-recall search "api" --json                # Output as JSON
```

**View statistics:**
```bash
npx claude-recall stats                    # Current project + universal + unscoped
npx claude-recall stats --project my-app   # Specific project + universal
npx claude-recall stats --global           # All projects
```

**Store memory directly:**
```bash
npx claude-recall store "I prefer TypeScript with strict mode"
npx claude-recall store "Use PostgreSQL" --type project-knowledge
```

### Intelligence & Evolution

**View memory evolution and sophistication metrics:**
```bash
npx claude-recall evolution                    # Last 30 days
npx claude-recall evolution --days 60          # Last 60 days
npx claude-recall evolution --project my-app   # Filter by project
```

**Example `evolution` output:**

npx claude-recall failures --project my-app   # Filter by project
```

**Example `failures` output:**
```
❌ Failure Memories (Counterfactual Learning)

1. Avoid: Reading file without existence check
   What Failed: Attempted to read config.json directly
   Why Failed: File does not exist at expected location
   Should Do: Verify file path exists before reading. Use fs.existsSync()
   Preventative Checks:
     - Verify file exists before reading (fs.existsSync)
     - Handle ENOENT errors gracefully

2. Avoid: Session-based authentication
   What Failed: Session-based auth implementation
   Why Failed: User reported: Doesn't scale across multiple servers
   Should Do: Use JWT tokens instead
```

### Data Management

**Export/import memories:**
```bash
npx claude-recall export memories.json          # Export all memories
npx claude-recall export backup.json --json     # Export as JSON
npx claude-recall import memories.json          # Import memories
```

**Clear memories (use with caution):**
```bash
npx claude-recall clear --force                 # Clear everything (requires --force)
```

### MCP Server Commands

**What are MCP commands?**
The MCP (Model Context Protocol) server is how Claude Code communicates with Claude Recall. When you install claude-recall, it automatically configures `~/.claude.json` to start the MCP server.

**Process Management:**
```bash
# Start/stop
npx claude-recall mcp start              # Start MCP server (auto-started by Claude Code)
npx claude-recall mcp stop               # Stop running server gracefully
npx claude-recall mcp restart            # Restart server
npx claude-recall mcp test               # Test MCP server functionality

# Monitoring
npx claude-recall mcp status             # Show server status for current project
npx claude-recall mcp ps                 # List all running MCP servers (all projects)

# Cleanup
npx claude-recall mcp cleanup            # Remove stale PID files and processes
npx claude-recall mcp cleanup --dry-run  # Preview cleanup actions
npx claude-recall mcp cleanup --all      # Stop all MCP servers (all projects)
```

**When to use:**
- **Auto-started**: Claude Code automatically starts the MCP server on launch
- **Manual management**: Stop, restart, or cleanup stale servers as needed
- **Troubleshooting**: Use `mcp ps` to see running servers, `mcp cleanup` to remove zombies
- **Testing**: Use `mcp test` to verify the server responds correctly

### Utilities

**Check installation status:**
```bash
npx claude-recall status        # Show installation and system status
npx claude-recall --version     # Show version
```

**Monitoring (advanced):**
```bash
npx claude-recall monitor                      # View search monitoring stats
npx claude-recall test-memory-search           # Test if Claude searches before file creation
```

**Migration:**
```bash
# Database schema migration
npx claude-recall migrate schema                # Migrate database schema (automatic)
npx claude-recall migrate schema --backup       # Create backup before migration

# Architecture migration (file-watcher → MCP)
npx claude-recall migrate                       # Migrate from file-watcher to MCP architecture
```

### Global Options

All commands support:
- `--verbose` - Enable verbose logging
- `--config <path>` - Use custom config file
- `-h, --help` - Show help for any command

## Project Management

Claude Recall maintains a **project registry** to track all projects using it, enabling better organization and visibility across multiple projects.

### Auto-Registration

Projects are automatically registered when:
- The MCP server starts (every time Claude Code connects)
- You run `npm install claude-recall` locally
- You manually run `npx claude-recall project register`

The registry stores:
- Project path
- Claude Recall version
- Registration date
- Last activity timestamp

### Project Commands

**List all registered projects:**
```bash
npx claude-recall project list              # Human-friendly output
npx claude-recall project list --json       # JSON format
```

Shows:
- Project name and path
- Claude Recall version
- Last activity
- MCP server status (active/inactive)

**Show project details:**
```bash
npx claude-recall project show              # Current project
npx claude-recall project show my-project   # Specific project
```

Displays:
- Registry information (path, version, timestamps)
- MCP server status (running/stopped, PID)

**Register a project:**
```bash
npx claude-recall project register          # Current directory
npx claude-recall project register --path /path/to/project
```

**Unregister a project:**
```bash
npx claude-recall project unregister        # Current project
npx claude-recall project unregister my-project
```

**Note**: Unregistering does NOT remove memories or MCP configuration - only the registry entry.

**Clean up stale entries:**
```bash
npx claude-recall project clean             # Remove projects not seen in 30 days
npx claude-recall project clean --days 60   # Custom threshold
npx claude-recall project clean --dry-run   # Preview without changes
```

### Enhanced MCP Commands

MCP commands now show registry information:

```bash
npx claude-recall mcp status    # Shows registry info + MCP status
npx claude-recall mcp ps        # Lists all servers with version info
```

### Registry Storage

Registry stored at: `~/.claude-recall/projects.json`

Format:
```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "projects": {
    "my-project": {
      "path": "/full/path/to/my-project",
      "registeredAt": "2025-11-09T...",
      "version": "0.7.5",
      "lastSeen": "2025-11-09T..."
    }
  }
}
```

**Note**: The registry is separate from your memory database. Cleaning the registry does NOT affect your stored memories.

## Project Scoping

Claude Recall now supports **project-specific memory isolation** while keeping universal preferences available everywhere.

### How It Works

- **Single global database**: `~/.claude-recall/claude-recall.db`
- **Three memory scopes**:
  - **Universal**: Available in all projects (coding preferences, tools)
  - **Project**: Only available in the specific project
  - **Unscoped** (default): Available everywhere (backward compatible)
- **Project ID**: Automatically detected from directory name

### Storing Memories

**Universal memories** (available everywhere):
```
User: "Remember everywhere: I prefer TypeScript with strict mode"
Claude: [Stores with scope='universal']
```

**Project-specific memories**:
```
User: "For this project, we use SQLite for the database"
Claude: [Stores with scope='project', project_id='my-app']
```

**Default** (unscoped, works like before):
```
User: "I prefer Jest for testing"
Claude: [Stores with scope=null, available everywhere]
```

### Searching with Scopes

**Default** (current project + universal):
```bash
npx claude-recall search "database"
# Returns: Current project memories + universal memories + unscoped
```

**Specific project**:
```bash
npx claude-recall search "database" --project my-app
# Returns: my-app memories + universal memories + unscoped
```

**All projects**:
```bash
npx claude-recall search "database" --global
# Returns: All memories from all projects
```

### Stats with Scopes

**Current project**:
```bash
npx claude-recall stats
# Shows: Memories for current project (claude-recall) + universal + unscoped
```

**All projects**:
```bash
npx claude-recall stats --global
# Shows: All memories across all projects
```

### Use Cases

**Universal memories** (scope='universal'):
- Coding style preferences: "Always use TypeScript with strict mode"
- Tool preferences: "Prefer Jest for testing"
- File naming conventions: "Name markdown files with lowercase-dash-case"

**Project-specific memories** (scope='project'):
- Database choice: "This project uses PostgreSQL"
- API endpoints: "API base URL is https://api.example.com"
- Build commands: "Run npm run build:prod for production"

**Unscoped memories** (scope=null, default):
- Backward compatible
- Works like v0.7.1 and earlier
- Available everywhere unless you explicitly scope them

### How Project Scoping Works (Installation Location)

**Important**: Where you install claude-recall (global vs local) does NOT affect project-specific memory scoping!

**What Determines Project Scope:**

1. ✅ **Claude Code's working directory** - Where you run Claude Code
2. ✅ **Database scoping logic** - Filters memories by project_id
3. ❌ **Installation location** - Doesn't matter for scoping

**How It Works:**

```
# Claude Code runs in this directory:
/home/user/projects/my-app

# Project ID detected from directory name:
project_id = "my-app"

# Memories stored/searched with that project_id:
- "For this project, use PostgreSQL" → stored with project_id="my-app"
- "Remember everywhere: I prefer TypeScript" → stored with scope="universal"

# Same behavior whether claude-recall is:
# - Installed globally: /usr/local/lib/node_modules/claude-recall
# - Installed locally: ./node_modules/claude-recall
```

**Database Location (Always Global):**

Whether you install globally or locally, the database is **always** at:
```
~/.claude-recall/claude-recall.db
```

This single database contains:
- Project-specific memories for each project (isolated by project_id)
- Universal memories (available in all projects)
- Unscoped memories (backward compatible)

**Example: Two Projects, One Installation**

```bash
# Project A:
cd ~/projects/project-a
# Claude Code detects: project_id = "project-a"
# Memories: isolated to project-a + universal + unscoped

# Project B:
cd ~/projects/project-b
# Claude Code detects: project_id = "project-b"
# Memories: isolated to project-b + universal + unscoped

# Same global installation, proper isolation!
```

**WSL Users:**

This is why **global installation in WSL** works perfectly for project scoping:
- Code location: `/home/user/.nvm/.../bin/claude-recall` (global)
- Project detection: Based on Claude Code's `cwd`, NOT installation path
- Memory isolation: Each project gets its own memories + universal preferences

Global installation actually **helps** WSL users by avoiding binary conflicts while maintaining perfect project isolation!

## Memory Management

Claude Recall automatically manages memory to prevent unlimited database growth, with user notifications:

### Current Limits
- **Maximum memories**: 10,000 total (configurable)
- **Database size threshold**: 10MB for automatic compaction
- **Queue message retention**: 7 days for completed messages

### User Notifications
- **Stats command** shows current usage: `8,234/10,000 (82.3%)`
- **Warning at 80%**: "⚠️ Note: Memory usage is high"
- **Critical at 90%**: "⚠️ WARNING: Approaching memory limit - pruning will occur soon"
- **During pruning**: "🔄 Pruned 500 old tool-use memories"
- **During compaction**: "🗜️ Compacting database... ✅ saved 2.3MB"

### Memory Retention by Type
- **Preferences**: Kept indefinitely (your coding style, tool choices)
- **Project Knowledge**: Kept indefinitely (database configs, API patterns)
- **Tool Usage**: Last 1,000 entries
- **Corrections**: Last 100 entries
- **Session memories**: Maximum 50 per session

### Manual Management
```bash
# Check database size and memory count (with usage percentage)
claude-recall stats

# Clear old memories
claude-recall clear --days 30        # Clear memories older than 30 days
claude-recall clear --type tool_use  # Clear specific type
claude-recall clear --all            # Clear everything (requires confirmation)

# Export before clearing
claude-recall export backup.json
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Customize limits
export CLAUDE_RECALL_MAX_MEMORIES=20000        # Increase memory limit
export CLAUDE_RECALL_COMPACT_THRESHOLD=20971520 # 20MB compaction threshold
export CLAUDE_RECALL_RETAIN_TOOL_USE=2000      # Keep more tool usage history
```

## Troubleshooting

### Memories not being retrieved?
1. Verify memories exist: `claude-recall stats`
2. Search manually to test: `claude-recall search "your topic"`

### Installation shows old version?

#### For global installation (CLI usage):
```bash
npm cache clean --force
npm uninstall -g claude-recall
npm install -g claude-recall@latest
claude-recall --version
```

#### For local installation (CLAUDE.md integration):
```bash
npm cache clean --force
npm uninstall claude-recall
npm install claude-recall@latest
npx claude-recall --version
```

### Performance issues?
- Check database size: `ls -lh ~/.claude-recall/claude-recall.db`
- Clear old memories: `claude-recall clear --days 30`
- The system uses SQLite with optimized indexes for fast retrieval

### Need Help?
Run this diagnostic script and share the output:
```bash
claude-recall --version
claude-recall stats
ls -lh ~/.claude-recall/claude-recall.db
node --version
npm --version
```

## Best Practices

1. **Be explicit about preferences** - Clear statements like "Always use..." or "Never..." are captured better
2. **Approve or correct** - Say "Good!" or "No, do this" after tasks to build the learning loop
3. **Trust the learning loop** - Direct MCP search finds preferences, successes, and failures instantly
4. **Correct mistakes immediately** - Corrections get highest priority and won't be repeated
5. **Review periodically** - Use `claude-recall stats` to see what's being remembered
6. **Export important memories** - Backup critical preferences with `claude-recall export`
7. **Fast and simple** - Direct MCP calls work great for most tasks (agent is optional)
