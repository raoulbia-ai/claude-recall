# Claude Recall

An MCP server that gives Claude persistent memory across conversations.

Every time you start a new conversation with Claude, you're starting from scratch. Claude doesn't remember your preferences, your project context, or the decisions you've made together. Until now.

**Claude Recall** is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that gives Claude persistent memory across conversations. It learns from your interactions and provides relevant context in future conversations, making Claude feel like a true collaborator who remembers your journey together.

## Key Features

### üß† Automatic Memory System
- **No manual commands needed** - Claude automatically searches for relevant memories based on your prompts
- **Context-aware** - Retrieves memories that are semantically related to your current conversation
- **Persistent across restarts** - Your preferences and context survive Claude Code restarts

### üìù Intelligent Capture
- **Automatic extraction** - Captures preferences, patterns, and important information from conversations
- **Categorized storage** - Organizes memories by type (preferences, project knowledge, corrections)
- **Priority-based** - More important or frequently used memories are prioritized

### üîí Privacy & Security First
- **100% Local** - All memories stored locally in SQLite (~/.claude-recall/)
- **No cloud sync** - Your data never leaves your machine
- **You own your data** - Export, view, or delete memories at any time
- **Zero telemetry** - No data collection or phone-home behavior
- **Security Audited** - Reviewed by Claude Code using `/security-review` command: No exposed secrets, SQL injection protection, 0 npm vulnerabilities

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Local Project Installation (Recommended)
For automatic CLAUDE.md integration in your project:
```bash
cd your-project
npm install claude-recall
```
This automatically adds Claude Recall instructions to your project's CLAUDE.md file.

### Option 2: Global Installation
For CLI access from anywhere:
```bash
npm install -g claude-recall@latest
```

**Note:** You can have both installations. For global installations, manually add this to your `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`:
```markdown
## Claude Recall Integration
- IMPORTANT: Always search memories before creating new files or making decisions
- Use `mcp__claude-recall__search_memory` to check for stored preferences and project knowledge
- Memories include: coding preferences, file locations, project patterns, and team conventions
```

After installation, verify with: `claude-recall --version` (or `npx claude-recall --version` for local installs)

## How It Works

When you chat with Claude, the system:
1. **Captures** your preferences and important information
2. **Stores** them locally in SQLite (`~/.claude-recall/claude-recall.db`)
3. **Retrieves** relevant memories when you start new conversations
4. **Injects** context so Claude remembers your preferences

### Example
```
You: "I prefer TypeScript with strict mode for all my projects"
[Claude Recall automatically stores this preference]

--- Later, in a new session ---

You: "Create a new module for user authentication"
[Claude Recall retrieves your TypeScript preference]
Claude: "I'll create a TypeScript module with strict mode enabled..."
```

## Memory Types

### Preferences
- Coding style preferences (languages, frameworks, patterns)
- Tool preferences (testing frameworks, build tools)
- Workflow preferences (git conventions, file structures)

### Project Knowledge
- Database configurations
- API patterns and endpoints
- Architecture decisions
- Dependencies and versions

### Context
- Current tasks and work in progress
- Recent decisions and changes
- Team conventions

### Corrections
- Learned from mistakes
- Updated patterns
- Deprecated approaches to avoid

## CLI Commands

### Essential Commands
```bash
# View statistics
claude-recall stats

# Search memories
claude-recall search "database configuration"

# Export memories
claude-recall export memories.json

# Import memories
claude-recall import memories.json

# Clear memories (use with caution)
claude-recall clear --type preferences  # Clear only preferences
claude-recall clear --force               # Clear everything

# Test memory capture (for debugging)
claude-recall capture user-prompt '{"content":"your message here"}'
```

## Memory Management

Claude Recall automatically manages memory to prevent unlimited database growth, with user notifications:

### Current Limits
- **Maximum memories**: 10,000 total (configurable)
- **Database size threshold**: 10MB for automatic compaction
- **Queue message retention**: 7 days for completed messages

### User Notifications
- **Stats command** shows current usage: `8,234/10,000 (82.3%)`
- **Warning at 80%**: "‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Memory usage is high"
- **Critical at 90%**: "‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Approaching memory limit - pruning will occur soon"
- **During pruning**: "üîÑ Pruned 500 old tool-use memories"
- **During compaction**: "üóúÔ∏è Compacting database... ‚úÖ saved 2.3MB"

### Memory Retention by Type
- **Preferences**: Kept indefinitely (your coding style, tool choices)
- **Project Knowledge**: Kept indefinitely (database configs, API patterns)
- **Tool Usage**: Last 1,000 entries
- **Corrections**: Last 100 entries
- **Session memories**: Maximum 50 per session

### Manual Management
```bash
# Check database size and memory count (with usage percentage)
claude-recall stats

# Clear old memories
claude-recall clear --days 30        # Clear memories older than 30 days
claude-recall clear --type tool_use  # Clear specific type
claude-recall clear --all            # Clear everything (requires confirmation)

# Export before clearing
claude-recall export backup.json
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Customize limits
export CLAUDE_RECALL_MAX_MEMORIES=20000        # Increase memory limit
export CLAUDE_RECALL_COMPACT_THRESHOLD=20971520 # 20MB compaction threshold
export CLAUDE_RECALL_RETAIN_TOOL_USE=2000      # Keep more tool usage history
```

## Troubleshooting

### Memories not being retrieved?
1. Verify memories exist: `claude-recall stats`
2. Search manually to test: `claude-recall search "your topic"`

### Installation shows old version?

#### For global installation (CLI usage):
```bash
npm cache clean --force
npm uninstall -g claude-recall
npm install -g claude-recall@latest
claude-recall --version
```

#### For local installation (CLAUDE.md integration):
```bash
npm cache clean --force
npm uninstall claude-recall
npm install claude-recall@latest
npx claude-recall --version
```

### Performance issues?
- Check database size: `ls -lh ~/.claude-recall/claude-recall.db`
- Clear old memories: `claude-recall clear --days 30`
- The system uses SQLite with optimized indexes for fast retrieval

### Need Help?
Run this diagnostic script and share the output:
```bash
claude-recall --version
claude-recall stats
ls -lh ~/.claude-recall/claude-recall.db
node --version
npm --version
```

## Best Practices

1. **Be explicit about preferences** - Clear statements like "Always use..." or "Never..." are captured better
2. **Correct mistakes** - When Claude gets something wrong, the correction is remembered
3. **Review periodically** - Use `claude-recall stats` to see what's being remembered
4. **Export important memories** - Backup critical preferences with `claude-recall export`
