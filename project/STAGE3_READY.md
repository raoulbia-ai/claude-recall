# Stage 3: Pattern Recognition - READY FOR TESTING

## Summary

Stage 3 has been successfully implemented and all automated tests are passing. The pattern recognition system can now detect and learn from code corrections.

## What Was Built

1. **Pattern Detector** (`src/core/patterns.ts`)
   - Detects corrections in code edits
   - Generalizes patterns (e.g., getUserData â†’ fetchUserData)
   - Categorizes by context (function, variable, etc.)

2. **Pattern Store** (`src/memory/pattern-store.ts`)
   - Saves patterns to SQLite database
   - Tracks frequency of similar corrections
   - Retrieves frequent patterns for learning

3. **Post-Tool Hook** (`src/hooks/post-tool.ts`)
   - Captures Edit tool results
   - Detects patterns in real-time
   - Integrates with pattern storage

4. **Comprehensive Tests** (`tests/unit/patterns.test.ts`)
   - All 7 tests passing
   - Covers pattern detection and storage

## Human Testing Required

Please follow the instructions in `test-instructions-stage3.md` to verify:

1. Patterns are detected when you correct Claude's code
2. Similar patterns increase frequency counts
3. Patterns persist across sessions

## Next Steps

After successful human testing:
```bash
# Verify patterns were captured
sqlite3 claude-recall.db "SELECT * FROM memories WHERE type='correction-pattern';"

# If patterns exist, continue to Stage 4
claude-flow swarm "Verify Stage 3 test results and continue with Stage 4 of /workspaces/claude-recall/project/docs/swarm-execution-plan.md"
```
