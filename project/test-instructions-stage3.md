## Stage 3 Human Testing - Pattern Recognition

Please test pattern detection from corrections:

1. Build and install latest version:
   ```
   cd /workspaces/claude-recall/project
   npm run build
   cp .claude/settings.json ~/.claude/settings.json
   ```

2. Start Claude Code and make corrections:
   - Ask: "Create functions for user data operations"
   - When Claude writes `getUserData()`, correct to `fetchUserData()`
   - When Claude writes `saveUser()`, correct to `persistUser()`
   - When Claude writes `deleteUser()`, correct to `removeUser()`

3. Check if patterns were detected:
   ```
   sqlite3 /workspaces/claude-recall/project/claude-recall.db \
     "SELECT * FROM memories WHERE type='correction-pattern';"
   ```

4. Make similar code and see if pattern is recognized:
   - Ask: "Create a function to get product data"
   - Check if Claude suggests `fetchProductData` (learning from pattern)

Expected: Database should contain correction patterns with frequency counts.
