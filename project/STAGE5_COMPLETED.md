# Stage 5: Memory Retrieval Enhancement - COMPLETED ✅

## Summary
Stage 5 successfully fixed the memory retrieval system to properly search for semantically relevant memories instead of just returning recent tool-use events.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Keyword Extraction
- Implemented `extractKeywords()` method in MemoryRetrieval class
- Extracts database-related keywords (postgres, mysql, sqlite, etc.)
- Filters common words and focuses on significant terms

### 2. Semantic Search
- Enhanced `searchByContext()` in MemoryStorage to search within memory values
- Uses SQL LIKE queries with keyword matching
- Supports multiple keyword searches

### 3. Memory Type Prioritization
- Added type-based sorting: project-knowledge > preference > tool-use
- Ensures important knowledge surfaces before recent events
- Implemented in both retrieval and storage layers

### 4. Query Propagation
- Modified pre-tool hook to extract user queries from tool inputs
- Supports various field names (query, prompt, question, content, etc.)
- Passes actual query content to retrieval context

### 5. Improved Relevance Scoring
- Keyword matches boost score by 2x per match
- Less aggressive decay for project-knowledge (30-day half-life)
- Additional boost when all keywords match

## Test Results

### PostgreSQL Test Case ✅
**Query:** "What database do we use?"
- **Before:** Returned SQLite or recent tool-use events
- **After:** Correctly retrieves PostgreSQL memory as top result

### All Validation Tests Passed ✅
1. Keyword extraction working
2. Semantic search finding relevant memories
3. Memory types properly prioritized
4. Query content successfully propagated
5. PostgreSQL retrieval test successful

## Files Modified
- `src/core/retrieval.ts` - Enhanced with keyword extraction and scoring
- `src/memory/storage.ts` - Added keyword search capability
- `src/hooks/pre-tool-enhanced.ts` - Extracts query from tool inputs

## Next Steps
Stage 6: Optimization & Polish can now proceed with a fully functional memory retrieval system.
