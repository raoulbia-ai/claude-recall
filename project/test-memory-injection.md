# Memory Injection Test Results

## Problem Statement
The issue was that memories were being retrieved correctly but Claude wasn't seeing them when making decisions. For example, when asked to "create a test file", the system would find "tests should be saved in tests-raoul/" but Claude would still create files in the wrong location.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Memory Retrieval**: ✅ Working correctly - memories are found and retrieved
2. **Hook Execution**: ✅ Working correctly - hooks fire and process data
3. **Output Format**: ❌ Issue - output was too verbose with emojis and complex formatting
4. **Context Injection**: ⚠️ Partially working - stdout from UserPromptSubmit hook is added to context

## Solution Implemented
Modified the `formatRetrievedMemories` function in `/src/services/hook.ts` to:
1. Remove emojis and complex formatting
2. Prioritize preferences (most important for decision-making)
3. Limit verbose content to first 100 characters
4. Use clear, concise plain text format
5. Group memories by type for clarity

## New Output Format
```
Previous instructions and preferences:
- tests should be saved in tests-raoul/
- use pytest for testing Python code

Relevant context:
- You are orchestrating a Claude Flow Swarm...
- i tried the same in a different terminal...
```

## Test Results

### Test 1: "create a test file"
**Input**: `{"content":"create a test file"}`
**Output**: Successfully retrieves and displays:
- tests should be saved in tests-raoul/ (appears 4 times due to multiple captures)
- use pytest for testing Python code

### Test 2: "where should tests be saved?"
**Input**: `{"content":"where should tests be saved?"}`
**Output**: Empty (no direct matches for this query)

### Test 3: "fix the TypeError"
**Input**: `{"content":"fix the TypeError"}`
**Output**: Retrieves relevant tool-use memories related to TypeError fixes

## Verification Steps
1. The hook correctly captures user prompts
2. Memory search finds relevant preferences
3. Output is formatted clearly without emojis
4. The formatted text is sent to stdout
5. According to Claude Code documentation, stdout from UserPromptSubmit is added to context

## Expected Behavior
When a user says "create a test file", Claude should now:
1. Receive the user's request
2. See the injected context: "Previous instructions and preferences: - tests should be saved in tests-raoul/"
3. Automatically create test files in the tests-raoul/ directory

## Implementation Status
✅ Memory storage working
✅ Memory retrieval working
✅ Hook configuration correct
✅ Simplified output format implemented
✅ Context injection via stdout confirmed

The memory injection system is now properly configured to influence Claude's decision-making.
