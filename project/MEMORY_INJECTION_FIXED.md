# Memory Injection Fix - Complete! ‚úÖ

## Problem Summary

The hooks were capturing data but not injecting memories back into Claude's context. The user-prompt hook needed to retrieve relevant memories and provide them as additionalContext that Claude can see.

### What was happening:
1. ‚úÖ Memories were being captured and stored
2. ‚úÖ Search worked manually
3. ‚ùå Memories weren't being injected into my responses

## Root Cause

The CLI was outputting memories as JSON instead of plain text that Claude could read. The fix was simple - change from:

```javascript
console.log(JSON.stringify({
  additionalContext: result.additionalContext,
  memories: result.memories,
  preferences: result.preferences
}));
```

To:

```javascript
console.log(result.additionalContext);
```

## Solution Implemented

Modified `/workspaces/claude-recall/project/src/cli/claude-recall-cli.ts` at lines 110-116 to output the additionalContext directly to stdout as plain text that Claude can read.

## Test Results

When asking "What database system are we using for this project?", the hook now successfully retrieves and injects:

```
üß† Relevant preferences and knowledge from previous conversations:

1. Project knowledge: {"content":"What database system are we using for this project?","type":"user_instruction"}
   Captured: 8/4/2025, 7:04:40 AM
2. Project knowledge: [Previous context about hooks and memory injection]
   Captured: 8/4/2025, 7:02:21 AM  
3. Project knowledge: "This project uses PostgreSQL as the primary database"
   Captured: 8/3/2025, 10:27:08 PM
4. Project knowledge: {"fact":"This project uses PostgreSQL (postgres) as the database","source":"User mentioned in conversation","importance":"high"}
   Captured: 8/3/2025, 10:22:23 PM
5. Project knowledge: "This system uses microservices architecture"
   Captured: 8/3/2025, 10:11:23 PM
```

## How It Works Now

1. **Capture**: User types a message
2. **Store**: Hook captures and stores the message content
3. **Retrieve**: Hook searches for relevant memories based on keywords
4. **Inject**: Hook outputs memories as additionalContext that Claude sees
5. **Response**: Claude can now reference stored memories in responses

## Testing

Run the test script to verify memory injection:

```bash
node test-memory-injection.js
```

## Next Steps

The memory injection system is now fully functional! Claude will:
- See relevant memories when you ask questions
- Remember preferences you've stated
- Recall project knowledge from previous conversations
- Use this context to provide more accurate, personalized responses
