# Building Brain-Inspired Memory for AI Coding Assistants

## Vision

Imagine an AI coding assistant that remembers like a human colleague - not through explicit commands or manual saves, but naturally and automatically. This document outlines the vision and technical approach for creating such a system.

## The Core Concept

### Human-Like Memory for AI

When you work with a human colleague, they naturally remember:
- Solutions you've discussed before
- Your coding preferences and patterns
- Context from previous conversations
- Related concepts and connections

Current AI assistants reset with each session. We envision an AI that maintains continuity through brain-inspired memory mechanisms.

### Key Principles

1. **Automatic Operation** - Memory capture happens transparently, without user intervention
2. **Psychological Realism** - Implements actual memory science, not just storage
3. **Intelligent Persistence** - Remembers what matters, forgets what doesn't
4. **Cross-Session Learning** - Builds knowledge over time, across all interactions

## Brain Science Foundations

### Memory Architecture

**Two-Stage System** (Inspired by Hippocampus → Cortex Transfer)
- **Working Memory**: Rapid storage of recent interactions with limited capacity
- **Long-Term Memory**: Consolidated storage of important information
- **Transfer Process**: Background consolidation moves significant memories to permanent storage

### Core Algorithms

**1. Forgetting Curve** (Ebbinghaus, 1885)
```
relevance = base_score * (0.5 ** (days_since_access / 7))
```
Memories naturally decay unless accessed, preventing information overload.

**2. Context-Dependent Retrieval** (Godden & Baddeley, 1975)
- Memories are stronger when recalled in similar contexts
- Same file/project/branch increases retrieval probability

**3. Associative Networks** (Spreading Activation Theory)
- Concepts mentioned together form connections
- Searching for one concept activates related memories

**4. Memory Consolidation**
- Frequently accessed memories strengthen
- Similar memories merge to form general patterns
- Unimportant details fade while core concepts persist

## Technical Requirements

### Automatic Capture Mechanism

The system must intercept all AI-assistant interactions transparently. Key requirements:

1. **Complete Coverage** - Capture every prompt and response
2. **Zero Latency** - No noticeable performance impact
3. **Reliability** - 99%+ capture rate
4. **Transparency** - Users shouldn't know it's there

### Potential Implementation Approaches

**1. Hook-Based Interception**
- Ideal: Direct integration with AI assistant's event system
- Challenge: Requires robust hook API from the platform

**2. Wrapper Approach**
- Command-line wrapper capturing stdin/stdout
- Simple but may miss GUI interactions

### Storage and Retrieval

**Storage Requirements**:
- Fast write performance for real-time capture
- Efficient indexing for associative retrieval
- Support for metadata (context, timestamps, access patterns)
- Scalable to years of conversations

**Retrieval Features**:
- Sub-second response times
- Context-aware ranking
- Associative expansion of queries
- Temporal decay calculations

## User Experience Goals

### The Invisible Assistant

Users should experience:
1. **Natural Continuity** - "Remember when we discussed that authentication approach?"
2. **Contextual Awareness** - Better suggestions when working on similar code
3. **Learning Behavior** - Improved assistance over time
4. **Effortless Interaction** - No memory management commands

### Example Interactions

**Scenario 1: Error Resolution**
```
User: "I'm getting a CORS error"
AI: "Based on our previous discussions about CORS in your React projects, 
     you typically resolve this by adding the cors middleware to Express.
     Last time (2 weeks ago), you used: app.use(cors({ origin: 'http://localhost:3000' }))"
```

**Scenario 2: Pattern Recognition**
```
User: "How should I structure this API?"
AI: "Looking at your past projects, you prefer:
     - RESTful endpoints with /api/v1 prefix
     - Separate route files by resource
     - JWT authentication with refresh tokens
     Should I follow this pattern?"
```

## Brainstorming - Phase 1: Core Objective Focus

### Primary Goal: Consistency & Efficiency in AI Pair Programming

The core objective is purely efficiency and effectiveness - smart retention of instructions, preferences, and guidelines to make AI pair programming consistent throughout a project. Psychological memory principles are just one possible approach to achieve this.

#### What Really Matters
- **Consistency**: AI maintains coding style, conventions, and decisions across sessions
- **Efficiency**: No repeated instructions or context-setting
- **Project-Specific Memory**: Guidelines and patterns stick to the project
- **Smart Filtering**: Only relevant memories surface in current context

#### Key Capture Points
- When user corrects AI-generated code → capture the preferred pattern
- When user rejects a suggestion → learn what to avoid
- When user explains a convention → permanent project rule
- When user approves code → reinforce that approach

#### Essential Memory Categories
- **Code Style**: Formatting, naming conventions, file organization
- **Project Architecture**: Design patterns, folder structure, module boundaries
- **Tech Preferences**: Preferred libraries, frameworks, approaches
- **Quality Standards**: Testing style, error handling, documentation format
- **Workflow Patterns**: Review process, commit style, development flow

#### Lightweight MVP Approach
- Simple key-value store for preferences
- Tag by project/language/context
- Fast retrieval without complex algorithms
- Focus on what improves consistency, ignore the rest

#### Success Criteria
- AI follows project conventions without reminders
- Reduced repetition of instructions
- Context-appropriate suggestions
- Minimal performance overhead

## Brainstorming - Phase 2: Hook-Based Architecture

### Leveraging Claude Code & Claude-Flow Hook Systems

Based on analysis of both Claude Code and Claude-Flow, a hook-based architecture appears ideal for capturing AI-human interactions and patterns.

#### Claude Code Hook System (Official)
- **Simple and reliable**: Hooks defined in `.claude/settings.json`
- **PreToolUse hooks**: Intercept before tools execute (Edit, Bash, etc.)
- **Python/shell scripts**: Receive tool data via JSON on stdin
- **Exit code control**: Can block operations or provide feedback

#### Claude-Flow Extended Hooks
Claude-Flow demonstrates a much richer hook ecosystem that could be adapted:

**Lifecycle Hooks Available:**
- **Pre-operation**: pre-task, pre-edit, pre-bash, pre-search
- **Post-operation**: post-task, post-edit, post-bash, post-search  
- **Session management**: session-start, session-end, session-restore
- **Coordination**: notify, mcp-initialized, agent-spawned
- **Learning**: neural-trained, memory-consolidation

**Key Infrastructure:**
- **SQLite storage**: Built-in memory store with metadata support
- **Namespaced keys**: Organized storage (e.g., `project/preferences/naming`)
- **Background processing**: Automatic consolidation and cleanup
- **Performance tracking**: Measure impact and optimize

#### Adaptation Strategy for Claude Recall

**Reuse Claude-Flow's Architecture:**
1. Copy the hook system infrastructure
2. Adapt from agent coordination to preference capture
3. Focus on consistency patterns rather than task coordination

**Key Capture Points via Hooks:**
```javascript
// post-edit hook captures corrections
{
  file: "api.js",
  original: "getUserData()",  
  corrected: "fetchUserData()",
  pattern: "prefer 'fetch' prefix for API calls"
}

// pre-task hook captures project context
{
  project: "my-app",
  language: "typescript",
  framework: "react"
}

// session-end consolidates learnings
{
  conventions: ["snake_case", "async/await", "jest"],
  corrections: 12,
  reinforcements: 45
}
```

**Testing Approach (Simplified):**
1. **Unit tests**: Verify hooks trigger and store data
2. **Integration tests**: Mock Claude Code environment
3. **Smoke tests**: Basic CLI commands work
4. **Manual validation**: Test in real Claude Code session

**Benefits of Hook Approach:**
- Already proven in Claude-Flow for complex coordination
- Non-invasive - doesn't modify Claude Code core
- Extensible - easy to add new capture points
- Performance - async hooks with minimal overhead
- Storage - SQLite handles large datasets efficiently

## Conclusion

The goal is to create an AI assistant that builds a genuine working relationship with developers through human-like memory. By implementing psychological and neuroscience principles in software, we can achieve a more natural, efficient, and trustworthy AI collaboration experience.

The technical challenge centers on automatic capture - without it, we lose the seamless experience that makes the system valuable. The focus should be on finding or creating reliable interception mechanisms that work transparently across different platforms and use cases.

This isn't just about storage or retrieval - it's about creating an AI that remembers like humans do: automatically, selectively, and intelligently.
