Last Updated: 2025-08-03 17:45

### Progress Overview
- [x] Stage 1: Project Foundation - **BUILT**
- [x] Stage 1: Human Testing - **PASSED** ✅
- [x] Stage 2: Memory Storage Layer - **BUILT**
- [ ] Stage 2: Human Testing - **PENDING** ⏳
- [ ] Stage 3: Pattern Recognition
- [ ] Stage 4: Memory Retrieval
- [ ] Stage 5: Hook Integration
- [ ] Stage 6: Optimization & Polish

## Stage 1: Project Foundation

### Completed Actions
1. **Swarm Execution Command:**
   ```bash
   claude-flow swarm "Execute Stage 1 of /workspaces/claude-recall/project/docs/swarm-execution-plan.md" --strategy development --max-agents 4 --coordinator
   ```

2. **What Was Built:**
   - ✅ Complete project structure with TypeScript and Jest
   - ✅ Basic hook capture system (HookCapture class)
   - ✅ Claude Code integration via `.claude/settings.json`
   - ✅ Unit tests (all passing)
   - ✅ Human test instructions generated

3. **Git Status:**
   - Branch: `feature/project-setup`
   - Status: Committed, not merged
   - Waiting for: Human verification before merge

### Stage 1 Test Results

#### Human Testing Results ✅
```
Hook capture log created: ✅
Edit tool events captured: ✅  
Bash tool events captured: ✅
Claude Code performance: ✅ (millisecond response times)
No errors in log: ✅
```

#### Captured Events:
1. Write tool: Created `hello.ts`
2. Edit tool: Changed `helloWorld` → `greetWorld`
3. Bash tool: Ran `npm test`

### Next Action: Continue to Stage 2

```bash
claude-flow swarm "Verify Stage 1 test results and continue with Stage 2 of /workspaces/claude-recall/project/docs/swarm-execution-plan.md"
```

## Session Information
- Claude Flow Version: v2.0.0-alpha.83
- Working Directory: `/workspaces/claude-recall/project`
- Execution Plan: `/workspaces/claude-recall/project/docs/swarm-execution-plan.md`

## Important Files
- Execution Plan: `docs/swarm-execution-plan.md`
- Test Instructions: `test-instructions-stage1.md`
- Hook Capture Log: `hook-capture.log`
- Settings: `.claude/settings.json`

## Notes
- Swarm completed Stage 1 in ~11 minutes
- Total cost: $2.09
- Human-in-the-loop testing is critical before proceeding
- Each stage requires: Build → Human Test → Verify → Merge

## Stage 2: Memory Storage Layer

### Completed Actions
1. **Created SQLite Schema:**
   - Memories table with full indexing
   - Support for project/file context
   - Access tracking and relevance scoring

2. **Implemented MemoryStorage Class:**
   - ✅ Save/retrieve operations
   - ✅ Context-based search
   - ✅ Access count tracking
   - ✅ Statistics retrieval
   - ✅ All unit tests passing (10/10)

3. **Integrated with Hooks:**
   - Updated pre-tool.ts to save events to SQLite
   - Maintains backward compatibility with log file
   - Database stored at `claude-recall.db`

4. **Git Status:**
   - Branch: `feature/memory-storage`
   - Status: Ready to commit after human testing
   - Test Instructions: `test-instructions-stage2.md`

### Next Action: Human Testing Required
```bash
# Human should follow test-instructions-stage2.md
# Then run:
echo "Stage 2 human testing complete" && sqlite3 claude-recall.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM memories;"
```

## Stage 3: Pattern Recognition (PENDING)

## Stage 4: Memory Retrieval (PENDING)

## Stage 5: Hook Integration (PENDING)

## Stage 6: Optimization & Polish (PENDING)
