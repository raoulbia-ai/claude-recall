# Stage 2: Memory Storage Layer - READY FOR TESTING

## Summary

Stage 2 has been successfully implemented and all automated tests are passing. The SQLite memory storage system is now integrated with Claude Code hooks.

## What Was Built

1. **SQLite Database Schema** (`src/memory/schema.sql`)
   - Memories table with comprehensive fields
   - Indexes for performance
   - Access tracking and relevance scoring

2. **MemoryStorage Class** (`src/memory/storage.ts`)
   - Save/retrieve memory operations
   - Context-aware search
   - Access count tracking
   - Statistics retrieval

3. **Hook Integration** (`src/hooks/pre-tool.ts`)
   - Captures all tool use events
   - Stores them in SQLite database
   - Maintains compatibility with log file

4. **Comprehensive Tests** (`tests/unit/storage.test.ts`)
   - All 10 tests passing
   - Covers all major functionality

## Human Testing Required

Please follow the instructions in `test-instructions-stage2.md` to verify:

1. Memory persistence across Claude Code sessions
2. Tool events are captured in the database
3. Database survives Claude Code restarts

## Next Steps

After successful human testing:
```bash
# Verify test results
sqlite3 claude-recall.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM memories WHERE type='tool-use';"

# If tests pass, continue to Stage 3
claude-flow swarm "Verify Stage 2 test results and continue with Stage 3 of /workspaces/claude-recall/project/docs/swarm-execution-plan.md"
```
