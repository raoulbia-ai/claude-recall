# Stage 4: Memory Retrieval - Build Complete

## Status: ✅ READY FOR HUMAN TESTING

### Implemented Features:

1. **MemoryRetrieval Class** (`src/core/retrieval.ts`)
   - Context-aware memory search
   - Relevance scoring with multiple factors:
     - Forgetting curve (time decay with 7-day half-life)
     - Project context boost (1.5x for same project)
     - File context boost (2x for same file)
     - Access frequency boost (logarithmic scale)
     - Recent access boost (1.2x if accessed within 24 hours)
   - Returns top 5 most relevant memories

2. **Enhanced Pre-Tool Hook** (`src/hooks/pre-tool-enhanced.ts`)
   - Retrieves relevant memories before tool execution
   - Formats memories for Claude Code context injection
   - Supports different memory types (patterns, preferences, etc.)
   - Logs retrieval activity for verification

3. **Comprehensive Unit Tests** (`tests/unit/retrieval.test.ts`)
   - Tests relevance scoring algorithm
   - Tests forgetting curve implementation
   - Tests context-aware filtering
   - Tests access count and recency boosts
   - All tests passing ✅

### Test Results:
```
Test Suites: 4 passed, 4 total
Tests:       24 passed, 24 total
```

### Human Testing Required:
Please follow the instructions in `test-instructions-stage4.md` to:
1. Test context-aware retrieval (frontend vs backend contexts)
2. Verify forgetting curve behavior
3. Confirm memory injection in hooks
4. Test access count updates

### Files Created/Modified:
- `src/core/retrieval.ts` - Core retrieval logic
- `src/hooks/pre-tool-enhanced.ts` - Enhanced hook with retrieval
- `tests/unit/retrieval.test.ts` - Unit tests
- `.claude/settings-stage4.json` - Updated hook configuration
- `test-instructions-stage4.md` - Human testing guide

### Next Steps:
After successful human testing, run:
```bash
claude-flow swarm "Verify Stage 4 test results and commit if successful"
```
