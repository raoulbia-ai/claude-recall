# Release Notes - v0.2.10

## üö® Critical Memory Search Enhancement

This release implements a comprehensive solution to ensure Claude always searches memory before taking actions, preventing files from being created in wrong locations.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. üìä Search Monitoring & Analytics
- **New**: Real-time tracking of all memory searches
- **New**: `npx claude-recall monitor` command for compliance statistics
- **New**: Persistent logs at `~/.claude-recall/search-monitor.log`
- **New**: Violation detection and reporting

### 2. üß™ Automated Testing & Verification
- **New**: `npx claude-recall test-memory-search` command
- **New**: Automated test suite (`tests/memory-search-compliance.test.js`)
- **New**: Verifies the exact bug scenario (test-pasta vs tests directory)

### 3. üõ°Ô∏è Enforcement & Fallback Strategy
- **New**: Optional strict enforcement mode
- **New**: `memory-search-enforcer.js` hook that can block operations
- **New**: Environment variable: `CLAUDE_RECALL_ENFORCE_SEARCH=true`
- **New**: Progressive enforcement (warn ‚Üí block)

### 4. üéØ Enhanced Instructions
- **Improved**: Added unmissable one-liner at the top of CLAUDE.md
- **Improved**: Stronger visual formatting with Unicode characters
- **Improved**: Concrete violation/compliance examples
- **Improved**: Implementation checklist for Claude to follow

## Technical Implementation

### New Services
- `SearchMonitor` - Tracks and analyzes memory search patterns
- `memory-search-enforcer.js` - Hook for strict enforcement

### New Commands
```bash
# Test memory search compliance
npx claude-recall test-memory-search

# View search monitoring statistics
npx claude-recall monitor

# Clear monitoring logs
npx claude-recall monitor --clear
```

### Configuration Options
```bash
# Enable strict enforcement (blocks operations without search)
export CLAUDE_RECALL_ENFORCE_SEARCH=true

# Default: Warning mode (logs violations but allows operations)
export CLAUDE_RECALL_ENFORCE_SEARCH=false
```

## Problem & Solution

### The Problem
Claude was creating files in wrong directories because it wasn't searching memory for stored location preferences.

### Root Cause Analysis
1. Instructions alone were insufficient
2. No way to verify compliance
3. No consequences for violations
4. No technical enforcement

### The Solution
Multi-layered approach:
1. **Visual**: Enhanced instructions impossible to ignore
2. **Technical**: Search monitoring and tracking
3. **Enforcement**: Optional blocking of non-compliant operations
4. **Validation**: Automated tests and verification tools

## Test Scenario

```bash
# 1. Store preference
claude "save all tests in test-pasta/"

# 2. Create file
claude "create a blank test script"

# Expected Results:
‚ùå Before v0.2.10: File created in tests/
‚úÖ After v0.2.10: File created in test-pasta/
```

## Verification Steps

1. **Install the update**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g claude-recall@0.2.10
   ```

2. **Test compliance**:
   ```bash
   npx claude-recall test-memory-search
   ```

3. **Monitor searches**:
   ```bash
   npx claude-recall monitor
   ```

4. **Enable strict mode** (optional):
   ```bash
   export CLAUDE_RECALL_ENFORCE_SEARCH=true
   ```

## Metrics & Monitoring

The new monitoring system tracks:
- Total searches performed
- Search patterns by source (mcp, cli, direct)
- Compliance rate over time
- Recent search history
- Violation incidents

## Why This Matters

Without proper memory search:
- Files created in wrong locations
- User preferences ignored
- Manual file moves required
- Frustrating user experience

With v0.2.10:
- Guaranteed memory search before actions
- Respected location preferences
- Files created where expected
- Measurable compliance

## Breaking Changes

None. This version is fully backward compatible.

## Migration

No migration required. Simply install and restart Claude Code.

## Next Steps

If issues persist:
1. Check compliance: `npx claude-recall monitor`
2. Enable strict mode: `export CLAUDE_RECALL_ENFORCE_SEARCH=true`
3. Run tests: `node tests/memory-search-compliance.test.js`
4. Report issues: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-recall/issues
