# Implementation Report: Automated Restart Support for Live Testing MVP

## Executive Summary

This report documents the successful implementation of an automated restart and continuity system for Claude Recall's live testing framework. The system enables continuous testing workflows that survive Claude Code restarts, automatically recovering state and resuming interrupted tests. This critical capability addresses the requirement that Claude Code must be restarted for hook and CLI changes to take effect.

## Implementation Overview

### Core Achievement
We have built a comprehensive restart continuity and live testing system that:
- **Detects and handles Claude Code restarts automatically**
- **Preserves test state across restart boundaries**
- **Resumes interrupted tests from checkpoints**
- **Injects test results as searchable memories**
- **Provides both CLI and MCP tool interfaces**

### Key Innovation
The system transforms the development workflow from a disruptive restart process to a seamless continuity experience where tests automatically resume and complete despite process interruptions.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Restart Continuity Manager
**Location:** `src/services/restart-continuity.ts`

**Responsibilities:**
- Process lifecycle management via PID lock files
- State persistence to disk (`~/.claude-recall/continuity/state.json`)
- Automatic restart detection and recovery
- Test checkpoint management
- Session ID generation and tracking

**Key Features:**
- **Restart Detection:** Uses lock files with PID checking to detect when Claude Code has restarted
- **State Recovery:** Automatically loads previous state and resumes operations
- **Checkpoint System:** Allows tests to mark progress points for granular recovery
- **Memory Injection:** Stores restart events and continuity state as searchable memories

### 2. Live Testing Manager
**Location:** `src/testing/live-testing-manager.ts`

**Responsibilities:**
- Orchestrates live testing sessions
- Manages file watchers for auto-restart triggers
- Coordinates with continuity manager for state preservation
- Handles test failure analysis and restart decisions

**Key Features:**
- **Configurable Restart Policies:** Control when and how restarts occur
- **File Watching:** Monitors critical files and triggers restarts on changes
- **Test Result Injection:** Automatically stores results as memories for AI analysis
- **Session Management:** Tracks test progress and restart attempts

### 3. CLI Commands
**Location:** `src/cli/commands/live-test.ts`

**Available Commands:**
```bash
claude-recall live-test start    # Start live testing session
claude-recall live-test status   # Check current status
claude-recall live-test stop     # Stop active session
claude-recall live-test continuity  # View continuity state
claude-recall live-test checkpoint <name>  # Add recovery checkpoint
claude-recall live-test restart  # Simulate restart for testing
```

### 4. MCP Tools
**Location:** `src/mcp/tools/live-testing-tools.ts`

**Available Tools:**
- `live_test_start` - Start testing with configuration
- `live_test_status` - Get current session status
- `live_test_stop` - Stop active session
- `continuity_status` - Get continuity state
- `continuity_checkpoint` - Add checkpoint
- `trigger_restart` - Manually trigger restart

## Implementation Details

### State Persistence Structure
```json
{
  "sessionId": "session_1234567890_abc",
  "testInProgress": true,
  "currentTest": {
    "name": "memory_persistence",
    "startTime": 1234567890,
    "scenario": {...},
    "checkpoints": ["start", "memory_stored", "validation"]
  },
  "pendingActions": [],
  "lastActivity": 1234567890,
  "restartCount": 2
}
```

### Memory Injection Schema
The system injects various types of memories for AI visibility:
- `test/result/injected/{testName}` - Complete test results
- `test/insight/fix/{testName}` - Suggested fixes
- `test/failure/{sessionId}/{testName}` - Failure details
- `restart/event/{sessionId}` - Restart events
- `continuity/current_state` - Current continuity state

### Restart Detection Algorithm
1. Check for existing lock file with previous PID
2. Verify if previous process is still running
3. If not running, load previous state from disk
4. Create new session ID while preserving state
5. Resume interrupted tests from checkpoints
6. Process any pending actions

## Key Capabilities

### 1. Automatic Test Resumption
When a test is interrupted by restart:
- State is automatically saved before shutdown
- On restart, the system detects the interruption
- Test resumes from the last checkpoint
- Results are consolidated across restart boundaries

### 2. Smart Restart Triggers
The system intelligently determines when to restart:
- **File Changes:** Monitors hooks, CLI, and service files
- **Test Failures:** Analyzes failures for restart-requiring issues
- **Manual Triggers:** Supports explicit restart requests
- **Compliance Violations:** Detects when violations need restart to fix

### 3. Comprehensive Monitoring
Real-time visibility into:
- Current test progress and status
- Restart count and history
- Checkpoint progression
- Pending actions queue
- Session statistics

## Usage Examples

### Starting a Live Test Session
```bash
claude-recall live-test start \
  -s memory_persistence search_compliance \
  --auto-restart \
  --restart-on-failure \
  --max-restarts 5
```

### Using MCP Tools
```javascript
await mcp_live_test_start({
  tests: [
    { name: "memory_persistence", params: {} },
    { name: "search_compliance", params: {} }
  ],
  config: {
    autoRestart: true,
    restartOnFailure: true,
    maxRestartAttempts: 3
  }
});
```

### Checking Status
```bash
claude-recall live-test status
