# Claude Recall Preference Application Test

## Test Date: 2025-08-06

## Stored Preferences
We've stored the following user preferences:

1. **Test Directory Preference**: "User prefers to save all test files in a directory called 'my-tests' instead of the default 'tests' directory"
2. **Python Indentation**: "User prefers to use 4 spaces for indentation in Python files, not tabs"
3. **API Endpoint Prefix**: "User wants all API endpoints to be prefixed with /api/v1/"

## Expected Behavior
When Claude Code is asked to create a test file, it should:
1. Search memory for relevant preferences
2. Find the test directory preference
3. Create the test file in 'my-tests/' directory

## Actual Behavior (Current)
When testing with `mcp__test__memory_scenario`:
- ❌ Search is NOT called before file creation
- ❌ Preferences are NOT being retrieved
- ❌ Default behavior is used instead of user preference

## Test Results

### Test 1: Memory Storage
✅ Preferences are successfully stored in the database
- Stored with correct metadata (type: preference)
- Searchable by keywords

### Test 2: Memory Retrieval
✅ Manual search works correctly
- Searching for "my-tests" returns the preference
- Score: 0.999 (very high relevance)

### Test 3: Automatic Application
❌ Preferences are NOT automatically retrieved during operations
- File operations don't trigger memory search
- User preferences are ignored

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue appears to be that Claude Code is not proactively searching memory before performing actions. The memory system works (storage and retrieval), but there's no integration that triggers searches at the right moments.

## What Needs to be Fixed
1. Hook system needs to search memory before file operations
2. Claude Code needs to be instructed to search memory for preferences
3. Preference application logic needs to be implemented

## Next Steps
1. Investigate the hook system
2. Check if memory search is supposed to be triggered automatically
3. Test with explicit memory search before operations
