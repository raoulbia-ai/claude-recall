# Agent-Architect

## Role: System Design & Architecture Lead  

### Current Assignment: Design SemanticPreferenceExtractor System

## Architecture Tasks

### Priority 1: SemanticPreferenceExtractor Design
- [ ] **PENDING** - Design SemanticPreferenceExtractor class interface and methods
- [ ] **PENDING** - Plan integration with existing PreferenceExtractor for backward compatibility
- [ ] **PENDING** - Define semantic intent matching pipeline architecture
- [ ] **PENDING** - Specify word embeddings integration approach

### Priority 2: Natural Language Understanding Pipeline
- [ ] **PENDING** - Design intent classification system (test_location, code_style, etc.)
- [ ] **PENDING** - Plan context-aware preference extraction
- [ ] **PENDING** - Define confidence scoring mechanism for semantic matches
- [ ] **PENDING** - Architect override resolution between pattern-based and semantic systems

### Priority 3: Migration Strategy
- [ ] **PENDING** - Plan migration from HTML marker system to semantic matching
- [ ] **PENDING** - Design backward compatibility layer for existing preferences
- [ ] **PENDING** - Plan removal strategy for non-functional HTML injection code
- [ ] **PENDING** - Define testing strategy to ensure no regressions

### Priority 4: Performance & Scalability
- [ ] **PENDING** - Design efficient word embedding lookup/storage
- [ ] **PENDING** - Plan caching strategy for semantic analysis results
- [ ] **PENDING** - Optimize memory usage for real-time preference extraction
- [ ] **PENDING** - Define performance benchmarks and monitoring

## Architecture Specifications

### SemanticPreferenceExtractor Class Structure
```typescript
// To be designed based on investigation findings
export class SemanticPreferenceExtractor {
  // Interface to be defined
}
```

### Integration Architecture
```typescript
// To be designed - integration points with existing system
interface SemanticIntegration {
  // Interface to be defined
}
```

### Word Embeddings Strategy
*(To be defined after research collaboration)*

### Migration Plan
*(To be defined after current system analysis)*

## Design Principles

1. **Backward Compatibility**: Preserve all existing functionality
2. **Semantic Accuracy**: Prioritize natural language understanding over pattern matching
3. **Performance**: Maintain real-time response capabilities
4. **Maintainability**: Create clear separation of concerns
5. **Extensibility**: Allow easy addition of new preference types

## Collaboration Requirements

- **With Agent-Researcher**: Need investigation findings before finalizing design
- **With Agent-Coder-1**: Coordinate on implementation feasibility
- **With Agent-Coder-2**: Align on testing architecture requirements
- **With Coordinator**: Regular design review checkpoints

## Status Updates

**Current Phase**: Awaiting research findings  
**Next Milestone**: Complete SemanticPreferenceExtractor design  
**Blockers**: Waiting for Agent-Researcher investigation results  
**Est. Completion**: TBD after research completion
