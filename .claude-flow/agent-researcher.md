# Agent-Researcher

## Role: Investigation & Analysis Lead

### Current Assignment: Analyze Broken NLP Implementation

## Investigation Tasks

### Priority 1: Current System Analysis
- [ ] **PENDING** - Analyze ClaudeNLPAnalyzer implementation in `/workspaces/claude-recall/project/src/services/claude-nlp-analyzer.ts`
- [ ] **PENDING** - Identify why HTML marker injection fails to capture responses
- [ ] **PENDING** - Document specific failure points in `createHiddenAnalysisContext()` method
- [ ] **PENDING** - Analyze PreferenceExtractor vs ClaudeNLPAnalyzer overlap and conflicts

### Priority 2: System Integration Points
- [ ] **PENDING** - Map how HookService integrates both systems (lines 124-198 in hook.ts)
- [ ] **PENDING** - Identify why `handleClaudeResponse()` method isn't being called
- [ ] **PENDING** - Document memory storage conflicts between systems
- [ ] **PENDING** - Analyze preference override logic effectiveness

### Priority 3: Natural Language Processing Gaps
- [ ] **PENDING** - Test current system with "hey, lets put tests in test-new from now on"
- [ ] **PENDING** - Document patterns that work vs fail
- [ ] **PENDING** - Identify semantic understanding limitations
- [ ] **PENDING** - Research word embedding approaches for intent matching

### Priority 4: Technical Debt Assessment
- [ ] **PENDING** - Catalog non-functional HTML injection code for removal
- [ ] **PENDING** - Identify working preference storage components to preserve
- [ ] **PENDING** - Document test coverage gaps
- [ ] **PENDING** - List performance bottlenecks
