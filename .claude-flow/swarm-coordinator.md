# Claude Flow Swarm Coordinator

## Mission: Fix NLP Integration Issue

### Current Problem Analysis
The Claude Recall system has a broken NLP implementation that:
- Injects HTML markers (`<\!-- 🔍 PREFERENCE_ANALYSIS: -->`) but can't capture Claude's responses
- Uses hardcoded patterns that don't handle natural language variations effectively
- Cannot process test cases like "hey, lets put tests in test-new from now on" naturally
- Has non-functional HTML injection code alongside working preference storage

### Target Solution
Implement a semantic intent matching system using:
- Word embeddings and context analysis
- SemanticPreferenceExtractor class with natural language understanding
- Remove non-functional HTML injection while keeping working preference storage
- Handle natural language variations seamlessly

## Swarm Structure

### Agent Assignments

1. **Agent-Researcher** - Investigation & Analysis
2. **Agent-Architect** - System Design & Architecture
3. **Agent-Coder-1** - Core Implementation
4. **Agent-Coder-2** - Testing & Integration
5. **Coordinator** - Task orchestration and quality assurance

### Task Hierarchy

#### Phase 1: Investigation (Agent-Researcher)
- Analyze current broken NLP implementation
- Identify specific failure points in HTML marker system
- Document working vs non-working components
- Research semantic intent matching approaches

#### Phase 2: Architecture (Agent-Architect) 
- Design SemanticPreferenceExtractor class structure
- Plan word embeddings integration approach
- Define natural language understanding pipeline
- Create migration strategy from HTML markers

#### Phase 3: Core Implementation (Agent-Coder-1)
- Implement SemanticPreferenceExtractor class
- Build semantic intent matching system
- Create word embeddings integration
- Remove non-functional HTML injection code

#### Phase 4: Testing & Integration (Agent-Coder-2)
- Test natural language variations ("hey, lets put tests in test-new from now on")
- Ensure preference storage compatibility
- Create comprehensive test suite
- Validate system performance

#### Phase 5: Quality Assurance (Coordinator)
- Validate all implementations
- Ensure no regressions in existing functionality  
- Confirm natural language handling works
- Sign off on completion

## Success Criteria

1. Natural language preferences processed correctly
2. No breaking changes to existing preference storage
3. HTML marker injection removed
4. Test case "hey, lets put tests in test-new from now on" works naturally
5. All existing tests pass
6. Performance maintained or improved

## Risk Management

- Maintain backward compatibility with existing preference patterns
- Preserve working database storage functionality
- Test extensively before removing old code paths
- Have rollback plan if semantic matching fails

## Communication Protocol

- Daily status updates in this document
- Blockers escalated immediately to Coordinator
- Cross-agent collaboration required for integration points
- Final review by all agents before deployment
